This outputs the average from every 2

#  Breakdown of the formula:
# SMAj: Represents the Simple Moving Average at position "j" in the data series.
# (1/k): This part simply divides the sum by the number of data points considered ("k") to calculate the average.
# âˆ‘ (i=j-1 to j+k-1) ai:
# âˆ‘: This symbol represents the "summation" operation, meaning we are adding up a series of values.
# i=j-1 to j+k-1: This indicates that we are summing up values from position "j-1" (one point before "j") to "j+k-1" (k points after "j"), effectively including "k" data points centered around "j".
# ai: Represents the value at position "i" in the data series
